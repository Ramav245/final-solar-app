                  We believe that solar is the most practical form of 
                  renewable energy on the planet and seek to make it 
                  accessible to as many people as possible. Empower yourself 
                  and your family with predictable electric rates and clean energy. 
                  By making the simple switch to solar with Trinity, you can save 
                  money for the things that matter 
                  most and protect the environment for generations to come.
